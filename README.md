# Snake-game
This project is a simple replication of the classic arcade game: snake game

How to run and play the game:
    After downloading the repository, run the command:
    javac GameBoard.java
    and then run the command
    java GameBoard
    This should pull up the GUI for the game and allow you to play

Goal of this project:
    My goal going into this project was to improve my java skills, and give myself a challenge. I wanted to code this game using no help from online tutorials or anythimg, and see if i could just think of a way to complete it on my own. I managed to do it on my own, but i feel like i probably didnt have the most optimal approach

Improvments i would like to make:
    I would like to have a smoother GUI with better animations
    There is an error where if you change directions super fast then the snake thinks it hits itself and the game ends
